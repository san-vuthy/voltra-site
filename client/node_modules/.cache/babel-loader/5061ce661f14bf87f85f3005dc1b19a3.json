In 2014, he created the first electric\n            bike rental company in Siem Reap to visit the temples of Angkor. But\n            this French engineer does not want to stop along the way and decides\n            with all these technological skills to create the first Cambodian\n            brand of electric scooters. For 3 years, research and travel allow\n            him to create a brand that can compete with major international\n            brands. The concept is born and the brand also:\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>WE ARE VOLTRA</b>, a trademark and especially “the first\n            Cambodian brand” specialized in two-wheeled electric vehicles in\n            Cambodia.
